\chapter{Related Work}
\label{ch:RelatedWork}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


This Chapterprovides an overview of the \ac{ppml} paradigm.
We start by defining Data Security and Data Privacy, in sections \ref{sec:DataSecurity} and \ref{sec:DataPrivacy} respectively. We detail each concept so that they provide an understanding of the differences between them.
Section \ref{sec:PrivacyImplicationsPersonalDataProcessing} presents the concepts of data processing and \ac{dm}, gives an overview of the \ac{crisp} model and defines the attack models that can be assumed when developing a \ac{ppdm} algorithm.
For developing a \ac{ppdm} algorithm, we can implement one or more of the privacy-preserving techniques briefly presented in Section \ref{sec:PrivacyPreservingTechniques}. 
We present \ac{ppml} in Section \ref{sec:PrivacyPreservingMachineLearning}. Finally, we discuss known use cases that show what can be achieved in Section \ref{sec:UseCases}.

\section{Summary}
\label{sec:SummaryRelatedWork}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The previous Sections provided an overview of the state of the art surrounding \ac{ppml}.
We started by defining Data Security and Data Privacy in Sections \ref{sec:DataSecurity} and \ref{sec:DataPrivacy}.
We described the concept of \ac{dm} and data processing, in Section \ref{sec:PrivacyImplicationsPersonalDataProcessing}.
In Section \ref{sec:PrivacyPreservingTechniques} we described privacy-preserving techniques that can be used in implementing a \ac{ppml} algorithm.
We presented \ac{ml} applied in \ac{dm} in Section \ref{sec:PrivacyPreservingMachineLearning}. Finally, we discussed known use cases that show what can be achieved in the field in Section \ref{sec:UseCases}.
