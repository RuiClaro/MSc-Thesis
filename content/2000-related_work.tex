This chapter provides and overview on the \ac{ppml} paradigm.
We start by defining Data Security and Data Privacy, in sections \ref{sec:DataSecurity} and \ref{sec:DataPrivacy} respectively. We detail each concept so that it gives an understanding of the differences between them.
Section \ref{sec:PrivacyImplicationsPersonalDataProcessing} presents the concepts of data processing and Data Mining, gives an overview of the CRISP-DM model, and defines the attack models that can be assumed when developing a \ac{ppdm} algorithm.
For developing a \ac{ppdm} algorithm, one can implement one or more of the privacy-preserving techniques briefly presented in section \ref{sec:PrivacyPreservingTechniques}. 
We present \ac{ml} applied in Data Mining in section \ref{sec:PrivacyPreservingMachineLearning}. Finally, we discuss known use cases that show what can be achieved in the field in section \ref{sec:UseCases}.
