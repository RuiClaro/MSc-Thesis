\todo[inline]{add a smallish intro to this section}

\ac{BARD} is composed of:

\begin{itemize}
	\setlength\itemsep{1em}
	\item A dataset to train the \ac{ML} algorithm, or the values representing the already trained algorithm.
	\item A sample or a set of samples that represent the input of the "user", to be predicted.
	\item A prediction algorithm that depends on the \ac{ML} algorithm and the privacy-preserving technique chosen.
	\item A set of toolkits for each of the techniques used.
	\item ...\todo{more?}
\end{itemize}
