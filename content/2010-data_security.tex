Data Security refers to protective digital measures that are applied to prevent unauthorized access to computers, databases, and websites that store data, as well as to prevent data destruction or alteration.

\subsection{Data Security Principles}
\label{ssec:DataProtectionGoals}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


We define here the core security principles widely accepted in the literature, often known as the CIA triad: \textit{Confidentiality}, \textit{Integrity}, and \textit{Availability} \cite{Hansen2015}.

\begin{itemize}

    \item \textit{Confidentiality} is defined as the property of data, and of services that process such data, that prevents them from being accessed by unauthorized entities.

    \item \textit{Integrity} is defined as the property of data, and of services that process such data, that prevents them from being modified in an unauthorized or undetected manner.

    \item \textit{Availability} is defined as the property that access to data, and services that process such data, is always possible when needed by the authorized parties and in a timely manner.

\end{itemize}


For applying Data Security measures, various technologies can be implemented:

\begin{itemize}

    \item \textit{Data backups} ensure that data that have been lost can be recovered. This technique is a standard procedure for most companies, since the permanent loss of crucial data can seriously cripple a company's business.

    \item \textit{Data erasure}, in contrast to backups, is a technique to permanently delete data from a hard drive or other digital media, to ensure that no sensitive data are leaked when a company wants to permanently remove an asset from usage, or when they required to do so by court order.

    \item \textit{Data encryption}, or disk encryption, refers to techniques that allow a user to encrypt data in a disk, such that the disk remains protected and cannot be decrypted by an unauthorized party.

    \item \textit{Identity-based security} is a method to limit the access to data such that only a user that has been authenticated and has permission to access a piece of data can do so.


\end{itemize}


These techniques offer ways to protect data, but sometimes this is not enough. Usually, due to programming bugs in the system, vulnerabilities occur in the software, allowing unauthorized parties to bypass these techniques and get access to data that should be confidential.

\subsection{Examples of Data Security Breaches} 
\label{ssec:ExamplesDataSecurityBreaches}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


Data Security breaches refer to attacks, usually through unauthorized access, to systems that contain private data. These attacks are commonly made by organized hacker groups to gain leverage against companies or to make a profit by selling the data in the black market. Next, we present some recent examples of Data Security breaches.
\begin{itemize}

    \item \textit{Sony Pictures hack}\footnote{\url{https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2014/12/18/the-sony-pictures-hack-explained/}}. In 2014, a hacker group leaked confidential data from Sony Pictures in an attempt to gain leverage with the company to make it comply to their demands. The hacker group threatened to commit acts of terrorism in theaters if Sony released a movie related to the North Korean leader.


    \item \textit{Ashley Madison data breach}\footnote{\url{http://fortune.com/2015/08/26/ashley-madison-hack/}}. In 2015, a group of hackers stole user data from the adultery website Ashley Madison, and threatened to release usernames and \ac{pii} if the website was not shut down.

    \item \textit{Yahoo! data breach}\footnote{\url{https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/14/yahoo-hack-security-of-one-billion-accounts-breached}}. In 2016, Yahoo! reported two separate data breaches occurring in 2014 and 2013, of over 1.5 billion user accounts, including Yahoo! email access, which in turn can reveal bank and family details as well as passwords for other services.
