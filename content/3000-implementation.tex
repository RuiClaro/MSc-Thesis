When building a platform in the scope of privacy-preserving \ac{ml}, we must consider not only the traditional steps in data processing mentioned in section \ref{sec:PrivacyImplicationsPersonalDataProcessing} and in Figure \ref{fig:crisp-dm}, but also have an increased care when preprocessing data to incorporate the cryptographic techniques that we used.
This chapter describes the work that was done in implementing a privacy-preserving \ac{ml} platform. We start off with a description of the datasets chosen to evaluate our platform \ref{sec:DatasetsImplementation}. Then, we explain the preprocessing that was done to those datasets \ref{sec:DataPreProcessingImplementation}.
Section \ref{sec:BaselineImplementation} presents the baseline implementation of the chosen \ac{ml} algorithms, resorting to a widely used \ac{ml} toolkit for Python.
In section \ref{sec:ExpandedAlgorithmsImplementation} the implementation of the prediction phase of the algorithms is detailed.
Finally, in section \ref{sec:CryptoDomainImplementation}, we detail which cryptographic protocols we used, why, and how we implemented them, mentioning which toolkits were used.
