My sincerest thanks to my supervisors Miguel Pardal and Jos\'{e} Port\^{e}lo for proposing this thesis, for the guidelines provided, for the help and advice that ultimately allowed the development of this work.

To my parents that allowed me to reach this goal, to my sister, my girlfriend, my family, my friends, my college colleagues, and my work colleagues, I give you my sincerest thank you.

A final word of appreciation to Altran for the opportunity of an internship in conjunction with this thesis.
