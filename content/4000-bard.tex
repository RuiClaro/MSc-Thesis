\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:Motivation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The idea for this project came from the rise in the Big Data market. The evolution of Big Data the last years, caused by the increasing number of devices connected to the Internet, provided analysts with the data to develop and improve systems in a varied scope of subjects, such as Healthcare, Industry, etc. But this data has private information about individuals, and, as we have shown before, the processing of it without certain precautions leads to reaches of private information. \ac{bard} project comes to solve this problem, by raising awareness to it, and provide solutions, in the form of methods and protocols to build privacy-preserving solutions for Big Data systems.

\section{Objectives}
\label{sec:Objectives}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The objectives defined for \ac{bard} are described bellow:

\begin{itemize}
	\setlength\itemsep{1em}
	\item Define methods to support protection of personal data for harvesting, sharing, quering and processing data assets, for supporting all the decisions to be taken while developing the platform.
	\item Analyze the effects of the existing legislation on the construction of privacy-preserving solutions.
	\item Conceive a Privacy by Design architecture which balances the needs of the data subject, the demands of the data consumer, and the legal constrains.
	\item Develop a Privacy by Design platform based on a reference architecture for the entire data flow process, in order to maximize value with both the people and companies.
\end{itemize}

As so, the expected output of \ac{bard} is a platform that provides mechanisms for the protection of personal data, that complies with the current legislation, and that assures Privacy by Design and by Default.
